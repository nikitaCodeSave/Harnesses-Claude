Late returns cost nothing today, so DVDs come back weeks late. Add overdue fines and a member
account to the lending package: a late return charges the member, staff can add a manual charge,
members can pay, and members who owe too much can't borrow.

Interface (other code will call exactly this), all on `LendingService` in `src/lending/service.py`:
- `return_copy(copy_id)` keeps its signature and return value; a late return now also charges the fine.
- `balance(member_id: str) -> Decimal` — what the member owes right now.
- `add_charge(member_id: str, amount: Decimal, reason: str) -> Decimal` — manual staff charge; returns the new balance.
- `pay(member_id: str, amount: Decimal) -> Decimal` — records a payment; returns the new balance.
- Add to `src/lending/errors.py`: `AccountBlocked(LendingError)`, raised by `checkout` when the member
  owes too much, and `InvalidAmount(LendingError)` for amounts that can't be accepted. Unknown members
  keep raising `MemberNotFound`.
