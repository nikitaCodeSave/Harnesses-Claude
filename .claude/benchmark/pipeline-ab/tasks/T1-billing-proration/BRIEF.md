Customers can't change plan right now: support has to cancel and resubscribe them by hand.
Add mid-cycle plan changes to the billing package: upgrades and downgrades, optionally
switching between monthly and annual billing, prorated so nobody pays twice for the same days.

Interface (other code will call exactly this):
- `BillingService.change_plan(subscription_id: str, new_plan_code: str, new_interval: Interval | None = None) -> Invoice | None`
  in `src/billing/service.py`. `new_interval=None` keeps the subscription's current interval.
- Return the invoice issued for the change (recorded in the store like every other invoice),
  or `None` when nothing is billed at the moment of the request.
- Add `InvalidPlanChange(BillingError)` to `src/billing/errors.py` for change requests that
  can't be honoured; keep using the existing error classes where they already fit.
